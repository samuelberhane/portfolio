The map is color-coded, making it easy to identify which countries have the most customers.
      
      The application also includes pie charts that display sales by category. This feature enables businesses to identify which products or services are selling the most and which ones are not performing well. This information can be used to adjust marketing strategies and make other changes to improve overall sales performance.
      
      Along with sales statistics, Office also displays all transactions made by each customer using a line chart. This feature allows business owners and administrators to track the buying patterns of individual customers and identify any trends or anomalies. The line chart displays the transaction history of a particular customer over time, showing the amount spent and the date of each transaction.
      
      In conclusion, Office is a powerful tool for businesses that want to manage their sales data effectively. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, it provides a comprehensive overview of sales data and enables businesses to make data-driven decisions. By analyzing transaction history data, businesses can improve their customer retention, increase sales, and identify areas for improvement.`,
